# Classifying Basic Shape Drawings w/ Neural Networks ðŸ§ 
Welcome! This repo consists of a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook where I develop my first neural network to classify drawings of basic shapes. The notebook covers the complete process, from data exploration, preprocessing, model building, etc. To view the notebook and delve into the project, please click on the link below. Enjoy my journey through my first Neural Network!
